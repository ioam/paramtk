ParamTk
=======

ParamTk is an optional Tkinter interface to
`Param <http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_, allowing easy
construction of GUIs from existing code.

Please see `ParamTk's website <http://ioam.github.com/paramtk/>`_ for documentation and
examples.


Installation
============

ParamTk depends on Tkinter (usually included as standard with Python),
`PIL with its Tk interface <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_,
and `Param <http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_.

Official releases of ParamTk are available at `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/paramtk>`_, and can be installed along with
dependencies via ``pip install paramtk`` or ``easy_install paramtk``.

Alternatively, after separately installing the dependencies, ParamTk
can be installed via ``python setup.py install``.
